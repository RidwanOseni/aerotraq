üõ∏ Aerotraq ‚Äì Decentralized Drone Flight Registry

AI Validation + IPFS + On-Chain Record-Keeping and IP Monetization Platform
Laying the foundation for tokenized drone IP assets via Story Protocol.

Surreal World Asset Buildathon Q2 2025

üöÄ Overview
Aerotraq is a cutting-edge decentralized drone management and simulation platform built with Next.js and TypeScript, featuring deep smart contract and AI integration. It empowers users to register drones, track simulated flights via DGIP (Drone Generated Identity Protocol) logs, and tokenize drone-generated data as Intellectual Property (IP) assets on the blockchain for monetization and transparent record-keeping.
Our platform directly addresses critical challenges in modern drone technology: traceability, secure flight validation, and decentralized IP management and monetization. By leveraging AI for compliance checks and blockchain for immutable records and royalty distribution, Aerotraq ensures urban airspace safety, facilitates scalable UAV adoption, and opens new avenues for data-driven revenue generation for drone operators.

üåü Features
Aerotraq offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to enhance drone operations and data management:
‚Ä¢
AI-Powered Flight Plan Validation: Users submit detailed flight plans, which undergo AI-powered compliance validation. This includes checking against regulations and No-Fly Zones using LlamaIndex and an OpenAIP Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. An AI agent (via OpenAI) then generates a comprehensive compliance report based on these findings.
‚Ä¢
Deterministic Rule Checks: Automated checks are performed on various flight parameters such as date, time, altitude, and drone specifications, ensuring adherence to regional airspace rules.
‚Ä¢
Decentralized Data Storage: Compliant flight data is serialized, its Keccak256 hash is calculated, and the data is uploaded to IPFS for decentralized and immutable storage.
‚Ä¢
On-Chain Registration: The flight plan hash is subsequently registered on-chain via a custom smart contract (address: 0x4f3880A15Ea6f0E1A269c59e44855a9963B86949) on the Story Aeneid Testnet (Chain ID 1315) to ensure immutability and uniqueness.
‚Ä¢
Secure DGIP Log Simulation & On-Chain Linking: The platform simulates real-time DGIP (Drone Generated Identity Protocol) telemetry logs, capturing data points like location, altitude, speed, heading, and battery, dynamically displaying the flight path. After simulation, the DGIP log data is processed, hashed, and uploaded to IPFS. This DGIP data hash is then linked on-chain to the initial flight registration record in the smart contract, creating a verifiable chain of custody for generated flight data.
‚Ä¢
Story Protocol IP Asset Tokenization & Monetization: Aerotraq integrates with Story Protocol's Aeneid Testnet to transform drone flight data into tokenized Intellectual Property (IP) Assets. This involves registering Programmable IP License (PIL) Terms (e.g., commercial remix terms allowing revenue sharing) and minting an NFT from an SPG (Story Protocol Graph) NFT contract, attaching metadata that points to the IPFS CIDs of the initial flight data and DGIP logs. Users can then claim accrued royalties in $WIP (Story Protocol's native token) generated from their tokenized IP Assets. The system includes functionality to simulate royalty payments and checks for the existence of a royalty vault for proper revenue distribution, demonstrating the full monetization lifecycle for DGIP assets.
‚Ä¢
Enhanced User Wallet Experience (Tomo Integration): The platform provides seamless wallet connection with social login capabilities through TomoEVMKit, wrapping the existing Wagmi setup for improved user adoption. It leverages Tomo's key management, which combines OAuth for convenience and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for robust private key security. Additionally, it offers in-app $WIP management services such as SWAP (token exchange) and ONRAMP (token purchase via card), streamlining cryptocurrency interactions directly within the application.
‚Ä¢
Security-first Design: Implements robust security measures through smart contract interactions and Tomo's advanced key management.
‚Ä¢
Developer-friendly Architecture: Features modular design, strong typing with TypeScript and Zod, and optimized dynamic imports for performance.
‚Ä¢
Cross-Platform Compatible: Works on Windows, Linux, and GitHub Codespaces.

üß™ How to Run Locally
This project consists of two key components: the drone-registry application (Python + Node.js) and the openaip-mcp-server (Node.js).
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/RidwanOseni/aerotraq.git
cd aerotraq
2. Set Up Your Environment Variables
Create a file named .env.local in the root directory of your aerotraq project, using the .env.example file (provided below) as a template. Populate it with your API keys and configuration details.

Required API Keys:
- OpenAIP API Key: Get your API key from [www.openaip.net](https://www.openaip.net) and add it to your .env.local file
- Llama Cloud API Key: Get your API key from [Llama Cloud](https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/login) and set it in your environment:

  # If using a command prompt:
  setx LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY "<your API key>"

  # If using PowerShell:
  $env:LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY = "<your API key>"

Important: For security, ensure your .gitignore file includes .env.local to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.
3. Set Up the Drone Registry App (Frontend + Python Backend)
Navigate into the drone-registry folder:
cd drone-registry
Node.js Dependencies
Install Node.js dependencies for the Next.js frontend:
npm install
npm install core-js-pure # Required dependency for TomoEVMKit if using Next.js
Python Environment and Dependencies
Set up a Python virtual environment and install the necessary packages.
On Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
The llama_validator.py script automatically initializes an SQLite database (flight_data.db by default) for storing flight mappings and IP details.
IPFS Daemon
Ensure your local IPFS daemon is installed and running. You can download IPFS from https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/.
To start it:
ipfs daemon
The drone registry app will attempt to connect to this daemon for file storage.
Configure Next.js
‚Ä¢
Transpile Packages: Ensure next.config.ts includes transpilePackages for wagmi, viem, @tomo-inc/tomo-evm-kit, etc., to resolve CommonJS/ESM interoperability issues. This is already configured in the provided next.config.ts.
‚Ä¢
TypeScript Configuration: In tsconfig.json, ensure module and moduleResolution are set to "NodeNext". This is also pre-configured.
4. Set Up the OpenAIP MCP Server (Node.js)
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the MCP server folder:
cd path/to/aerotraq/mcp-server/openaip-mcp-server/
Install Node.js dependencies:
npm install
Build and start the server:
npm run build
npm start
5. Run the Application
Once both the drone-registry app and the openaip-mcp-server are running, and your IPFS daemon is active, you can start the main application:
From the drone-registry directory (where your .env.local file is):
npm run dev
Your application should now be running locally, typically on http://localhost:3000.
Important Notes for Local Development:
‚Ä¢
Hydration Errors: The WagmiProviderWrapper.tsx explicitly sets ssr: false for TomoEVMKitProvider to address potential React hydration errors caused by server-side rendering discrepancies.
‚Ä¢
Wallet Private Key: When configuring WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY for the Story Protocol SDK, ensure you are using a testnet private key and never your mainnet private key for security reasons.
üîó How the Pieces Work Together
1.
Drone Registry Backend (Python Application): Your main application receives user requests (e.g., flight data submission) via Next.js API routes.
2.
OpenAIPClientIntegration (within your Python Backend): This component manages the connection to the MCP server. It's responsible for making tool calls to the MCP server.
3.
OpenAIP MCP Server (Node.js Process): This is a separate Node.js application launched as a subprocess by your Python backend using stdio_client. The server expects the OPENAIP_API_KEY environment variable, which is passed to it by the Python client upon launch.
4.
Standard I/O (stdio): The Python client and Node.js server communicate using Standard Input and Standard Output streams of the server subprocess. The MCP SDK handles the protocol messages exchanged over these streams.
5.
OpenAIP API: This is the external API provided by OpenAIP. Your OpenAIP MCP server code makes HTTP requests to this API (using the OPENAIP_API_KEY it received) to perform tasks like No-Fly Zone validation.
6.
Workflow:
‚ó¶
A user provides flight data to your Drone Registry Backend.
‚ó¶
The backend initiates the validation process, which includes calling the OpenAIPClientIntegration.
‚ó¶
If not already connected, the OpenAIPClientIntegration launches the OpenAIP MCP Server subprocess.
‚ó¶
The validate_flight_data method uses the established MCP session to send a "tool call" request (e.g., validate-nfz) to the OpenAIP MCP Server subprocess, passing the flight data as arguments.
‚ó¶
The OpenAIP MCP Server receives the tool call, uses the OPENAIP_API_KEY to make a call to the actual OpenAIP API, performs the NFZ check, and sends the result back to the Python client.
‚ó¶
The Python client processes this result and returns it to your backend's API route, which then uses this validation to inform the user or proceed with subsequent steps like blockchain registration and IP tokenization.
