## Step-by-Step Description

### The user/pilot opens the app
The system (with AI agents) requests all necessary flight information:  
drone specifications, flight plan, date, time, duration, location, etc.

### AI validates and prepares flight registration
The AI agent checks data consistency and completeness.

It may suggest recommendations to comply with regulations (if applicable).

### Public blockchain registration
The AI sends flight data to the registration smart contract on the blockchain.

A unique identifier is generated and stored immutably, making it universally accessible.

### Option to purchase decentralized insurance
The AI offers the user the option to buy a decentralized insurance policy for the flight.

It collects relevant information and facilitates the payment in cryptocurrency via the insurance smart contract.

Once completed, the blockchain records the transaction, and the user receives digital proof of coverage.

### Claims process (in case of an incident)
If an incident/accident occurs, the user files a claim within the app.

The AI gathers evidence (flight data, photos, location, witness statements, etc.)  
and submits it to the claims smart contract.

The blockchain registers the claim and opens a “challenge” period during which  
other agents (or humans) can contest or verify the information to prevent fraud.

### Review and compensation
If the claim is uncontested (or valid after a failed challenge), the smart contract releases compensation to the pilot.

If the claim is contested and proven invalid, no compensation is issued.

The final resolution (payment or rejection) is recorded on the blockchain.

More details to the smart contracts
/*

    uint256 public droneId;

    event RegisteredFlight(uint256 indexed droneId, address indexed registrant);

    constructor() {
        droneId = 0;

I will be explaining this project in details, that is the smart contract
1. We have the license Identifier
2 We have our state variable, which allows users to access it
3 Then we have our user-defined variable event that is used to be able to call out the value emitted to regulate the movement in the smart contract or what the Engineer is doing
//  event RegisteredFlight(uint256 indexed droneId, //address indexed registrant);
6    Then, to create a constructor that is  called only once for the owner
7   Then the function that we called a local variable was assigned to a value

   
//  function registerFlight() public {
  //      droneId += 1;
        emit RegisteredFlight(droneId, msg.sender);
  //  }
  Then, we have to emit to tell the user who will be using the Dapp that we have only the droneID and him/her as the owner.
