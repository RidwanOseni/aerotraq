# üõ∏ Aerotraq ‚Äì Decentralized Drone Flight Registry

AI Validation + IPFS + On-Chain Record-Keeping and IP Monetization Platform
Laying the foundation for tokenized drone IP assets via Story Protocol.

Surreal World Asset Buildathon Q2 2025

## üöÄ Overview

Aerotraq is a cutting-edge decentralized drone management and simulation platform built with Next.js and TypeScript, featuring deep smart contract and AI integration. It empowers users to register drones, track simulated flights via DGIP (Drone Generated Identity Protocol) logs, and tokenize drone-generated data as Intellectual Property (IP) assets on the blockchain for monetization and transparent record-keeping.

Our platform directly addresses critical challenges in modern drone technology: traceability, secure flight validation, and decentralized IP management and monetization. By leveraging AI for compliance checks and blockchain for immutable records and royalty distribution, Aerotraq ensures urban airspace safety, facilitates scalable UAV adoption, and opens new avenues for data-driven revenue generation for drone operators.

## üåü Features

Aerotraq offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to enhance drone operations and data management:

- **AI-Powered Flight Plan Validation**: Users submit detailed flight plans, which undergo AI-powered compliance validation. This includes checking against regulations and No-Fly Zones using LlamaIndex and an OpenAIP Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. An AI agent (via OpenAI) then generates a comprehensive compliance report based on these findings.

- **Deterministic Rule Checks**: Automated checks are performed on various flight parameters such as date, time, altitude, and drone specifications, ensuring adherence to regional airspace rules.

- **Decentralized Data Storage**: Compliant flight data is serialized, its Keccak256 hash is calculated, and the data is uploaded to IPFS for decentralized and immutable storage.

- **On-Chain Registration**: The flight plan hash is subsequently registered on-chain via a custom smart contract (address: `0x4f3880A15Ea6f0E1A269c59e44855a9963B86949`) on the Story Aeneid Testnet (Chain ID 1315) to ensure immutability and uniqueness.

- **Secure DGIP Log Simulation & On-Chain Linking**: The platform simulates real-time DGIP (Drone Generated Identity Protocol) telemetry logs, capturing data points like location, altitude, speed, heading, and battery, dynamically displaying the flight path. After simulation, the DGIP log data is processed, hashed, and uploaded to IPFS. This DGIP data hash is then linked on-chain to the initial flight registration record in the smart contract, creating a verifiable chain of custody for generated flight data.

- **Story Protocol IP Asset Tokenization & Monetization**: Aerotraq integrates with Story Protocol's Aeneid Testnet to transform drone flight data into tokenized Intellectual Property (IP) Assets. This involves registering Programmable IP License (PIL) Terms (e.g., commercial remix terms allowing revenue sharing) and minting an NFT from an SPG (Story Protocol Graph) NFT contract, attaching metadata that points to the IPFS CIDs of the initial flight data and DGIP logs. Users can then claim accrued royalties in $WIP (Story Protocol's native token) generated from their tokenized IP Assets.

- **Enhanced User Wallet Experience (Tomo Integration)**: The platform provides seamless wallet connection with social login capabilities through TomoEVMKit, wrapping the existing Wagmi setup for improved user adoption. It leverages Tomo's key management, which combines OAuth for convenience and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for robust private key security.

- **Security-first Design**: Implements robust security measures through smart contract interactions and Tomo's advanced key management.

- **Developer-friendly Architecture**: Features modular design, strong typing with TypeScript and Zod, and optimized dynamic imports for performance.

- **Cross-Platform Compatible**: Works on Windows, Linux, and GitHub Codespaces.

## üîÑ Workflow Summary

1. **User Input**: Flight specifications are entered in the frontend.

2. **Validation**:
   - A Python script performs deterministic checks on flight parameters.
   - The Python script calls a Node.js-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for no-fly zone validation using OpenAIP data.
   - An AI agent (powered by OpenAI and LlamaIndex) generates a comprehensive compliance report based on all validation findings.

3. **IPFS Storage**: Validated flight data is serialized, hashed (Keccak256), and uploaded to IPFS. The IPFS Content Identifier (CID) is returned.

4. **On-Chain Initial Flight Registration**: The calculated hash of the initial flight plan is registered on the custom smart contract via Wagmi.

5. **DGIP Logging**: The application simulates real-time drone telemetry, generating DGIP logs.

6. **On-Chain DGIP Link**: Users can trigger a process to hash the simulated DGIP log data and link this hash to the initial flight registration record on the smart contract.

7. **Story Protocol IP Tokenization**: The platform facilitates minting an IP asset via the Story Protocol SDK, attaching programmable IP license terms (PIL), and enabling future monetization and listing of the tokenized drone data.
